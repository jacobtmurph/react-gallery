An example web-gallery built in React

# Requirements for this project

This project requires a `config.js` file in the `src` folder.

in the `config`, there should be a flickr api key provided via the following format:

```
const apiKey = 'YOUR KEY HERE';

export default apiKey;
```

When this file is provided, and all dependancies are installed via `npm install`, running `npm start` will properly display the application.
